# 🌍 3D Earth Visualization (Practice Project)

This is a practice project where I built a realistic 3D Earth using three js to explore 3D rendering, textures, and visual effects.

The goal of this project was to learn and experiment.

# ✨ Features

🌎 3D Earth model

🗺️ High-quality Earth textures

☁️ Separate cloud layer

🧱 Bump / normal mapping for surface detail

💡 Realistic lighting and rotation

🎥 Smooth 3D rendering

# 🛠️ Tech Stack

Three.js 

JavaScript

Texture maps (bump, clouds, etc.)

# 📚 Credits & Learning Resources

This project was inspired by a YouTube tutorial.
I used the video as a learning reference and implemented the project by modifying the logic on my own.

# 📌 Note

This is a learning/practice project, built to explore ideas and gain hands-on experience.
